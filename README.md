An immersive website to launch the new videogame.


QUESTIONS:

Did you achieve your goal? Was it easier or harder than expected?
>> Yes, I managed to get it working. It was a bit harder than I expected because of some setup issues with Tailwind, but I learned how to fix them.

If it didn’t work, why not? What happened? What resources did you use to try and figure it out? What did you learn from it not working?
>> At first it didn’t work because of a Tailwind/PostCSS version change. I checked YouTube tutorials, read error messages carefully, and tried different commands until I found a solution. I learned how to install the correct packages and adjust configuration files when versions change.

What would you do differently next time?
>>I would double-check the versions of all packages before starting, follow updated documentation for the tools I’m using, and keep notes of every fix so setup is faster in the future.
